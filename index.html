        <p>
            So i decided to make this because for one i dont want to loose mystuff and also beacuase i would love to be able to one day look back and see how i thought, this allows me to always have my "work" and in this way im always able to look, compare and improve.
            <br>
            So i will start with the oldest things i have writen

        <h1>Dream Stuff</h1>
        <p>I go into it, but then i started feeling more at home. No, rather I started remembering my home. I started feeling no need for this current existanc. I was ready. I see it as there being more than one dream state. The initial state; maybe subconciuos, where thoughts from throughout the day are played back. The deep state; the state at which most of the time nothing is remebered, the state at which we are no more here. These are the two major states that I have come to know although there is a state that i can call the mindless state, one of relaxation but at the same time the mind is still aware of the body and the bodily conection.</p>

            The only reason I am where I am is because I was able to notice the difference between consciousness and unconsciousness. The greatest gift of all, yet the most annoying reminder that consciousness is >

                    There is a constant conflict in my mind of whether to be or not to be... consciousness

            To think or not to think
        </h1>
        <p>
            That is the question. To wonder or not to wonder. It confuses me. The knowledge that I do attain, from unknown sources, sends me down similar paths and although I know that the path is to greater consciousness I can't help but want to stay on the level I am. I can't help but feel that I'm not going to be able to experience the level of joy I experience currently. When I increase in consciousness I often feel that majority of our daily routine is pointless, I then start drifting. Considering I am in this material world all the time it is not logical of me to focus on anything else but this world. But then again I wouldn't be able to get intune if it were not to be done. It could just be a choice. One to be decided upon based on one's journey. I know that I can "move on", but I am afraid. Afraid of loss, afraid of the unknown. Thinking ab this could just be a Mountain that we all have to climb in order to get to the peak of consciousness. That is the goal. But the peak of consciousness could cause me to render everything I know as useless, pointless.

                    Current song im listening to had a weird connection wiith what i was typing in a certian way.
                    A good question that i still find myself internally struggling with. The feeling of attaining what i assume is consciousness is on eof greatness in comparison to everything ive felt before. <br>

        </h1>
        <p>
            Forgetting the past is a blessing and a curse. It blocks wisdom and creates a seemingly ever lasting challenge. Although it helps with moving on, it almost blocks out future referencing. Future reference in the case of learning from your past, if you can't remember, how can you have learnt.
            <br>
            Possible ways to overcome:
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Reflect on the day that has passed
                </li>
                <li>
                    Note the lessons and/ scenarios that have occurred prior to the time of reflection
                </li>
                <li>
                    Understand.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            The journey to attain wisdom is ever lasting, things are ever changing. I see wisdom as being power as a pose to knowledge, BC wisdom is learning from your mistakes and understanding how to not repeat where as knowledge is knowing in, a sense. Wisdom allows you to act on experience and allows you to be able to predict what could happen, I say "could" BC like stated previously things are constantly changing. I assume things are constantly changing BC if things were to not change everything would just be predictable, pointless.

            Message to Aunty Nadine
        </h1>
        <p>
            Aunty nadine I have to say 
            <br>
            And I typed it out now so that I say it as i actually think about it
            <br>
            You are the one person on this planet, the one person I will ever know who will motivate me to be the thing I actually am. To be present. To just be alive. Alive in a sense of being here you know. You made me aware of being conscious, that's the word. You have no idea how you have made me the person I am. I know I dont have to say this be you already understand but I'm going to say it anyway I honestly hate the fact that I'm not always talking to you but I rather speak to you when I am fully conscious than talk to you while I am in a mindset to just pass time
            <br>
            You know exactly how to get me into almost full consciousness and it's like you give me that sip of consciousness I need to actually look for the bottle
            <br>
            I am so grateful I know you
            <br>
            And remember
            <br>
            Please never forget
            <br>
            You are the reason I have become the person I am today, here, in this place, in this dimension
            <br>
            I know I am the person I am
            <br>
            But you are the one you makes me bring myself to this place
            <br>
            And I have no words to describe how that makes me feel
            <br>
            I can only day thank you
            <br>
            I can say so so much more
            <br>
            But my words cant ever describe what you mean to me and what I want to say An important saying that the book you gave me said, that stayed with me since I read it is words can not describe feelings bc each word means a little something different to everyone
            <br>
            I'm paraphrasing but I know you know what I mean
            <br>
            I typed this out while you were talking to jamie bc I know that I'm not gonna be in the proper mind set to describe myself in a few minutes but just know Please never forget
            <br>
            When ever you look at me remember you are the reason I have brought myself to this place Idk how to describe this place so I'll just say "this place"
            <br>
            I really want to say more but I feel as though Honestly
            <br>
            I feel as though the time will come
            <br>
            I will soon figure out how to make my present mind last
            <br>
            But I've found out Based on trial and error I can focus my consciousness
            <br>
            But I just need to do it more
            <br>
            I haven't been conscious a lot recently and that's why I haven't been in a lot of contact Right now as I'm typing I am lost for a description for my next thoughts but the one word that comes to my mind is soon
            <br>
            And ya
        </p>

                    I feel like this is a very important message becauseit shows myself that i am infact aware of my minds state at the time and i say this because i am not at this state constantly.

            Meaningless Conversation
        </h1>
        <p>
            Having a conversation with her is draining mainly beacause she is emotionally and intellectually blocked by her need to be right and because she looks to be called the villan. I say this because she will hear only when she is critisized and stop listening. I feel as though her need to dectate will block our relationship for a long time because I have a need to be heard. This comes from the fact that I am forced to listen and after 'I have no opinion or right to have one'. This has caused both good and bad characteristics in me and I acknowledge both. I want to work on our relationship. Not because I think all will be dandy, but because I feel its going to affect Zak most and it seems like Zak is not being prioritised.
            <br>
            i think i should make a HTML doc about this

            If you need something surely you should do whatever it takes to get it
            <br>
            Wait, if you say you need something*...
            <br>
            To 'need' something then make/accept an excuse to not get it is not a need. It is a want to need.
            <br>
            In my context, if help is needed you'll accept it from anyone in order to solve the problem. Right?
            <br>
            Apparently not. We choose to stay in our struggles so that we have something to complain about, something that will allow us to recieve pitty. All this is <b>MY OPINION</b> based on what I witness. It seems to me that its not help that is 'needed' but pitty or maybe it is even a cry for attention.
            <br>
            Whatever it you or I choose it to be, it surely is...

            <h3>John 12:24</h3>
            Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.

            <br>

            Its so weird how ive heard it so many times

            <ul>
                <li>to die to yourself </li>
                <li>to die to the flesh </li>
                <li>death to self </li>
                <li>and now ego death </li>
            </ul>
            <br> <br>
            A verse that I just found sums it all up:
            <br> 
            <h3>Ephesians 4:22-24</h3>
            That, in refrence to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deciet, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness amd holiness of the truth.
